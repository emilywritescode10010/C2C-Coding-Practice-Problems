Problem 1: Acronym Generator

Description:
Write a program that takes a phrase or sentence as input (e.g., "Federal Bureau of Investigation") and generates the corresponding acronym (e.g., "FBI"). The acronym should be formed by taking the first letter of each word and converting it to uppercase.

Example:
 Input: "Random access memory"
 Output: "RAM"






Problem 2: Temperature Converter

Description:
Create a program that first asks the user which temperature scale they would like to convert from (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin). Then, ask which temperature scale they would like to convert to. Afterward, prompt the user for the temperature value and perform the conversion.

Supported conversions (for example):
 Celsius <-> Fahrenheit
 Celsius <-> Kelvin
 Fahrenheit <-> Kelvin

Example:
 Conversation:
  Program: "Which scale are you converting from? (C/F/K)"
  User: "C"
  Program: "Which scale are you converting to? (C/F/K)"
  User: "F"
  Program: "Enter the temperature in Celsius:"
  User: "100"
  Output: "100° Celsius is 212° Fahrenheit."






Problem 3: Longest Word Finder

Description:
Create a function that, given a sentence, determines the longest word and returns it. If there are multiple words of the same maximum length, return the first one that appears in the sentence.

Example:
 Input: "Coding is both fun and challenging"
 Output: "challenging"
